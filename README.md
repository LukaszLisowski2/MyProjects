# Mini Projects in Python
My name is Lukasz Lisowski. I am currently a 2nd year Finance and Management student at Northumbria University. I have started learning Python few months ago independently in order to build my technical skills. I will store here all my financial projects in Python from basic ones to the most challenging ones which will be updated in a future.

My mini projects as of Feb.14:

1. Basic correlation between Bitcoin and Ethereum
2. Monte Carlo Simulation of Alphabet Stock
3. Black Scholes Implementation Model
4. Option Pricing for Palantir Technologies using Monte Carlo Geometric Brownian Motion
